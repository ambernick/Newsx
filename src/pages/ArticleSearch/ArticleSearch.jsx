// we need to render search form, that includes our query information, which on submit gets sent to the back end to handle our API call

// class component: because our state is going to be our form data that we are submitting

// onsubmit and handlechange functions, which will update the formData, and then will trigger the apir-call in services, which then talks to the backend server 


// results that are returned will rendered in APIAritcle Card, which will have a button to add the article to req.user's collection 
// another set of handle change functions?
