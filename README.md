# NEWSX
January 2021

We live in the era of information overload. How can we possibly organize the onslaught of world events, political news, and local updates? NEWSX, an online article compiler and organizer, works to solve that problem.

NEWSX requires a user to create a user profile. From there, the user can search the API for thousands of news stories and save them to their personal collection. Once saved to their collection, users can add comments to the articles or reply to other usersâ€™ comments on the articles. If a user no longer wishes to have an article in their collection, they can delete it from their user profile.
